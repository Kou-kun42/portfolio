This is a personal portfolio site that I created to showcase my projects and highlight my skills.


### Deployment

This project is fully deployed on my own home server using docker.  All of the changes and docker specific files can be found on the [docker branch](https://github.com/Kou-kun42/portfolio/tree/docker) of this project.  The live link to this site can be found here:
